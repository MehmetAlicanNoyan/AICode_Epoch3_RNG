# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 3: Hacking a Random Number Generator (RNG)

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 3.

## Challenge description

RNG's are used in a wide range of fields one of which is cryptography. In this challenge, you will be asked to build a machine learning model that can predict the next “random” number by looking at the previous numbers generated by the RNG.

This challenge is prepared by [Mehmet Alican Noyan](https://github.com/MehmetAlicanNoyan).
